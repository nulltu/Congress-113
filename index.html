                About Us
            </h2>
            <p>
                Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
                government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold
                their public
                officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
                Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
                spend
                taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
                governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
                Government is doing.
                We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
                effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
                public
                officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
                become
                actively engaged in American government.
                TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public
                feedback
                to identify information of greatest use to the public.

                <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                <p>
                    In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to
                    public opinion dates back at
                    least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
                    doctrine of state secrecy, a
                    core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this
                    end can also be traced to
                    this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                    territory) enacting free press
                    legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and
                    that of the philosophes
                    more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                    sphere.

                    Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                    freedom of the press enshrined
                    provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
                    constitutional articles. In the
                    nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                    vigorously opposed by a
                    number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
                    latter.

                    Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                    often linked to the
                    passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the
                    first freedom of
                    information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century
                    and Finland continuing
                    the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of
                    Official Documents in
                    1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).

                    The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                    Information Acts (AIAs) or
                    equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
